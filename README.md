# OCVM | OnePlus13 camera mod

**OCVM** is a camera mod that aims at optimizing and boosting all aspects of *OnePlus 13* imaging process. Given that Oppo camera stack provides an immense level of flexibility via whopping amount of comprehensive config interfaces to control many parts of imaging system directly. And with most important parts of the stack - HAL and its subcomponents being almost identical to those of *Oppo find x8 ultra* (*fx8u*). This opens a plethora of possibilities to experiment with and provide an all-rounder full-fledged package.
Mod comes in two packages: 
- A `main module` that is designed to optimize both the stock camera application boosting its quality, as well as third-party cameras (like *gcam*) but with less impact as that would require more low-level patches, that may (or may not) be added in the future. 
- An `addon module` with processing ported from *Oppo find x8 ultra* that affects stock app only.

> ## :one: Main module
> Aims at general optimization with image quality being major priority. Fights atrocious levels of sharpening & denoise, corrects various oplus mistakes/overlooks, disables what shouldn't be, enables what should, adds & reworks what can be reused from *fx8u*.
